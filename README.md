# iCVR
Cockpit Voice Recorder - RESTful API. Team Project by Isaac, Connor, Vlad, and Ran.

### Problem Statement

Pilots use lingo related to their job that average people will have a difficult time understanding. Our web service will
allow the user to enter the text in question, and our program will decipher the meaning into common English.

### Application Functionality
* Let's assume that the user has an unformatted text (string of characters) that requires translation.
* The user enters this text into a browser's address bar using one of provided links. Each link represents an output
that the user may prefer. Currently, there are three pre-formatted options available: Simple Text, HTML, and JSON.

**Restrictions**: The length of the user's text should not exceed 2000 characters.
